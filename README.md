## Drilling & Well Integrity Researcher | Emerging Data Analyst

#### Technical Skills: Python, Data Analysis, Research & Development

#### Summary
Currently based in Stavanger, Norway, I am completing a Ph.D. in Drilling and Well Construction at the University of Stavanger. My doctoral research centers on zonal isolation and hydraulic sealability, where I explore advanced cementitious systems—including geopolymers and expansive additives—to enhance long-term well integrity. This involves extensive laboratory experimentation, material characterization, and cross-disciplinary collaboration with academic and industry stakeholders. My work is deeply grounded in applied science and engineering, but I also embrace data-driven methodologies, actively learning Python for data analysis to complement experimental design, modeling, and optimization workflows. I believe data-centric thinking is indispensable in modern energy systems and engineering R&D.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned an M.Sc. in Oil and Natural Gas Engineering from the China University of Petroleum and a B.Sc. in Petroleum Engineering from KNUST in Ghana. I also contributed to various research and teaching roles—including with the Design Thinking Ghana Hub and at the University of Energy and Natural Resources—focusing on fluid systems, materials testing, and project analysis. My recent work has been published in reputable venues such as the SPE International Drilling Conference and Geoenergy Science and Engineering, highlighting innovations in geopolymer performance for P&A and well cementing.

I am passionate about solving practical energy challenges by blending field-based engineering experience with data analytics and scientific rigor. I also co-supervise graduate projects and previously led a student entrepreneurship initiative (StartUIS), where I advocated for applied innovation.
